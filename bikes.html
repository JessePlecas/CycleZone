                    <p class="prod-detail">Giant is the world's leading brand of high-quality bicycles and cycling gear. 
                        Part of the Giant Group, which was founded in 1972, the brand combines

                        work with Giant and supply their bikes, if you have your eye on a

                    <p class="prod-detail">Cube is a large Germanic bike company, held in high regard for quite some time due to
                        producing incredibly well designed bikes at affordable prices. The reasons behind their great pricing 
                        is all their bikes are hand assembled in their Bavarian factory. Cube bikes have much 
                        better components than most others and offer an excellent ride.
                        CycleZone have a collection of Cube bikes in store though if your chosen bike happens to not be in 
                        store we would be happy to order it in for you.

                    <p class="prod-detail">Liv is the sister to Giant, so you can be assured that quality is still there for every single design. 
                        The designers at Liv put women first, with every bike frame perfectly measured and assembled with the women and their
                        comfort in mind. Liv ensure that all the specs are perfectly suited to the individual bike so that you don't have to. 
                        Cyclezone have a number of Liv bikes in store for you to look at and take home, though as always- if you have your eye on a 
                        particular Liv bike which is not in store just let us know and we'll have it ordered for you right away.
