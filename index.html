                        for an electric bike. The scheme covers your new bike and gear, 
                        so you can get moving in style and save up to 52% of the retail 
                        price of bike and equipment. <br> If your employer has yet to register, 
                        just send them <a href="https://www.biketowork.ie/employer-register">here</a> and you'll be a few clicks away
