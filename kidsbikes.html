                    <p class="prod-detail">Cube is a large Germanic bike company, held in high regard for quite some time due to
                        producing incredibly well designed bikes at affordable prices. The reasons behind their great pricing 
                        is all their bikes are hand assembled in their Bavarian factory. Cube bikes have much 
                        better components than most others and offer an excellent ride.
                        CycleZone have a collection of Cube bikes in store though if your chosen bike happens to not be in 
                        store we would be happy to order it in for you.
